# Plant-Detection
Plant Detection is an AI-powered project that identifies plants from images using machine learning and computer vision. It helps in recognizing plant species quickly and accurately, with potential applications in agriculture, research, and education. The project makes plant identification smarter, faster, and more accessible.
This project is an AI-based Plant Detection System that uses machine learning and computer vision to identify plant species from images. The main goal is to make plant recognition faster, more accurate, and accessible for practical applications in agriculture, research, education, and environmental conservation.
The system works by training a machine learning model on a dataset of plant images. When a new image is provided, the model processes it and predicts the plant species with high accuracy. By leveraging deep learning and image processing, the system can handle variations in lighting, angles, and backgrounds, making it more reliable in real-world conditions.
